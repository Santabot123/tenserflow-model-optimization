This is an example of diferent tenserflow model optimization technics. <br>
<br>
In this example, Chest X-Ray dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) was used. <br>
<br>
To run it, you need to specify the path to the Chest X-Ray dataset in ```main.py```. After that, you can apply various optimization techniques to the model specified in create_model() function in ``main.py``. <br> 
<br>
To zip models in the ```./models``` folder, run zip.py
